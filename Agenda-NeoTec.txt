                                           NeoTec: Network Operation for Telecom Cloud 

Background:
Telecom cloud refers to the cloud system operated by a network operator. As Telecom cloud evolves towards multi-cloud and edge cloud models, how the network operation dynamically meets the needs of the cloud service has been a big concern. This side meeting will discuss the use cases, requirements and possible work in management and operation of network for Telecom Cloud. This presents both challenges and opportunities for collaboration, particularly within the IETF.
